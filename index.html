      <h2>For you My Love❤️</h2>
      <p>Dear Love,</p>
      <p>
        You are the most beautiful part of my life. Every moment with you is a
        treasure, and I love you so much.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am so lucky to have you. I'm thankful because you love me, and I can
        feel that. I am motivated to do something good because of you. I am very
        proud to have you in my life. I won't waste the chance you've given me.
        I have found a very rare gem, and I will treasure it for sure. I'm sorry
        for bullying you sometimes, and I'm sorry I keep teasing you, but always
        remember, I love you so much. I want you by my side and to be my number
        one supporter for the rest of my life.
      </p>
      <p>Forever yours,</p>
      <p>Heneral Lina</p>
